# AC Load Estimator

How much power do you need in order to keep people cool?

Write a program to estimate the power needed for an AC unit. Your program 
should get input from the user, use the formula to calculate the horse power, 
then print the horsepower.

Calculate AC load with this equation:

```python
horsepower = width * height *  0.1 + number_of_people * 0.06
```

## Steps

1. Get the input from the user.

You'll need to ask for:
- `width` of the room
- `height` of the room
- `number_of_people` in the room

2. Calculate the horsepower using the formula

3. Print out the horsepower.

Run the tests to check your answer.

## Testing

Check that your solution is correct:

1. First, run your code with `python3 main.py` and try different 
  inputs to confirm that it is working.
2. Then, run `python3 test_main.py` to check your program with the automated tests.
